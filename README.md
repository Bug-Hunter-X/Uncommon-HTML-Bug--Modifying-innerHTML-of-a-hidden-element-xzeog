This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to modifying the `innerHTML` property of a hidden element.  The bug is that changes made to the `innerHTML` of a hidden element may not render correctly when the element's visibility is later changed. This behavior is not consistently handled across all browsers. The solution provides a workaround that ensures the changes are reflected.
